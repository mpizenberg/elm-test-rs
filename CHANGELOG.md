## [0.1.1] - (2020-12-19) [(diff)][diff-0.1.1]

#### Added

- `CHANGELOG.md` to record important changes.
- Includes a stealthy `--watch` option explaining why it is not needed.
- Print elm-test-rs version to stderr at the beginning of output.

#### Changed

- Do not overwrite the generated `elm.json` for the tests if identical.
  This considerably speeds up the compilation step since the elm
  binary uses timestamps to invalidate cache.

#### Removed

- Dependency to lazy_static
