    --help                       # Print this message and exit
    --version                    # Print version string and exit
    --quiet                      # Reduce amount of stderr logs
    --watch                      # Rerun tests on file changes
    --compiler /path/to/compiler # Precise the compiler to use (defaults to just elm)
    --seed integer               # Run with initial fuzzer seed (defaults to random)
    --fuzz integer               # Precise number of iterations of fuzz tests (defaults to 100)
    --workers integer            # Precise number of worker threads (defaults to number of logic cores)
    --filter "substring"         # Keep only the tests whose descriptions contain the given string

                                 #    online-oldest: the oldest compatible dependencies are picked to run tests
                                 #    progressive: try offline first and if that fails, switch to online-newest
