# how to keep this file up to date:
#
# 1. keep the `version` in sync with the version in `cargo.toml`. Nothing bad
#    will happen if you don't do this, but it's nicer to get bug reports
# 2. rebuild with nix whenever you update `cargo.lock` to get the new
#    `cargoSha256`. It will give you a more useful error if you replace the hash
#    with all 0s before building.
#
# In the longer term, this file could be submitted to nixpkgs to make it easier
# for Nix users to install elm-test-rs. That's probably the right move once it
# hits 1.0.0!
